# Instance filtering

Migration Manager uses [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) for selecting instances to be assigned to batches.
See [Batches](batches) for more information about batch configuration.

Expr is an expression language that uses a Go-like syntax with some more human-readable operators.

```{note}
For a full list of available functions and examples for more advanced expressions, see the full language definition at https://expr-lang.org/docs/language-definition

Migration Manager has the following extended functions:
* `path_base(string)` -- returns the final part of a path tree (e.g. /path/to/foo -> foo)
* `has_tag(<category>, <tag>)` --  returns whether the `<tag>` exists in the `<category>` (Use * for all categories)
* `matches_tag(<category>, <tag>)` -- returns whether any tag contains the text `<tag>` in the <category> (use * for all categories)
```

```{note}
Expressions evaluate on instances after overrides have been applied.
```

```{note}
Field names of instances are the same as the `properties` field of the JSON or YAML representation shown over the API or in the `migration-manager instance show` commands with the addition of `source` and `source_type`.
